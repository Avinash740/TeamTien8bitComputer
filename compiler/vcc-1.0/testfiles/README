testfiles

This directory contains a number of example C files that demonstrate various
aspects of the compiler.  It's probably best to run them with the -at options so
you can examine their output.  Also running with the -o option is helpful so you
can save individual assembly files.  e.g. to compile qsort.c, run this command:

	% vcc -t -o qsort.asm qsort.c

This creates the qsort.asm file which is the final assembly program, and v.tmp,
which is an intermediate file, probably easier to read than qsort.asm--it's 
commented.
